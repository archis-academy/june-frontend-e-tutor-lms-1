        We cover everything you need to build your first website. From creating your
        first page through to uploading your website to the internet. We’ll use the
        world’s most popular (and free) web design tool called Visual Studio Code.
        There are exercise files you can download and then work along with me. At the
        end of each video I have a downloadable version of where we are in the
        process so that you can compare your project with mine. This will enable you
        to see easily where you might have a problem. We will delve into all the good
        stuff such as how to create your very own mobile burger menu from scratch
        learning some basic JavaScript and jQuery. If that all sounds a little too
        fancy - don’t worry, this course is aimed at people new to web design and who
        have never coded before. We’ll start right at the beginning and work our way
        through step by step.
